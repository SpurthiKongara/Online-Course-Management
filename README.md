# 🎓 Online Course Management Website

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a **web-based course management system** designed to showcase secure login,
course enrollment, and syllabus presentation. It simulates how students can log in, view available courses,
and enroll in them, while ensuring only authenticated users gain access.

The site is deployed live via GitHub Pages:  
👉 [Online Course Management](https://spurthikongara.github.io/Online-Course-Management/)
